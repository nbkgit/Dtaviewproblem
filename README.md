Our Software uses a sql server. and no spaces or German special characters are used.

Our customer has a American windows 11 and has the same problem tat came this week from fedayee to wednes day

I added a sql script for the database, so that you can use the software. in the debug folder you find a konfiguration.xml where you need to change the ip adress of the sql sever you are using.

When you start the software you are ask for a user and password there you click simply on ok
The next messagebox has also be closed by using the OK button
in the last window you will be ask to enter a password which is euro-gard-2020

This is a GaMP 5 software written for the customer. usually we only allow visitor with a NDA to see the code or the software. so please keep this confidential and delete the software and database after testeing it.

when you click on Neu(new) you can add a new row to the database. all fileds have to be entered with correct data
